              When more students choose high-quality next steps after high
              school, not only are they better off, we can shift the demand
              patterns in higher education and employment away from low-quality
              programs/jobs, towards higher quality ones. As the postsecondary
              education system shifts to changed demand patterns, over time,
              this increases a community&apos;s systemic economic and social
              mobility.

                  James carries with him over 15 years of experience in the
                  education sector. James believes all learners deserve support
                  to navigate their post-secondary education journey with
                  confidence. Growing up, his mother, Fredrica, instilled in him
                  a simple yet powerful belief: with hard work, anything is
                  achievable. He is painfully aware that promise is not true for
                  everyone today; and is steadfast in that mission to shape a
                  world where every individual has the opportunity to fully
                  realize their potential.

                  Ryan York has worked in education for 18 years as a teacher,
                  instructional coach, principal, and charter school founder /
                  co-CEO. Throughout his career, he has been passionate about
                  the intersection of technology and student outcomes. Ryan
                  began writing software over a decade ago, creating online
                  tools for teachers. He went on to design a computer science
                  curriculum and learning management platform that served over
                  10,000 students and won the Sally Ride & Deloitte National
                  Award for Innovation. Ryan believes intentionally designed
                  technology can and should serve as a catalytic force to
                  address inherent inequities in schools and society and is
                  honored to be moving that work forward with the Willow team.
